/**
  * The (covariant) Yoneda lemma says that for a set valued
  * functor F from a category with small Hom-sets the values
  * for an object r in the source category just are
  * natural transformations from the Hom(r, -) functor
  * to F(r).
  *
  * In other words, natural transformations to functions
  * are in bijection with the values of the functor.
  *
  * Looking at type signatures, you'll see that Yoneda
  * as a datatype curries a functor's map on the value side.
  *
  * This is in line with the proof of the Yoneda lemma
  * which amounts to showing that liftYoneda and
  * lowerYoneda really do work, in other words
  * that values are determined by lifting the identity
  * across our natural transformation.
